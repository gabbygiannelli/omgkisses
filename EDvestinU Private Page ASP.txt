          <p><sup>1</sup> APR or &quot;annual percentage rate&quot; is a calculation of what the loan will cost, taking into consideration interest, fees and length of loan. Accordingly, the APR is subject to increase or decrease due to factors such as changes in the interest rate of variable rate loans, changes in principle due to the capitalization of interest or presence of a cosigner. Variable APR rates may increase or decrease depending on fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) index. Monthly interest rate accrual is based on the published One&ndash;Month London Interbank Offered Rate (&quot;LIBOR&quot;) as of the last business day of the previous month plus your applicable margin. <% =strLiborRate %> Lowest rate requires application with a cosigner and 0.50 percentage point interest rate reduction for Autopay benefit. The interest rate reduction for authorizing our servicer to automatically deduct monthly payments from a savings or checking account will not reduce the monthly payment, but will reduce the monthly finance charge, resulting in a lower total cost of loan. APR’s provided include a 0.50 percent interest rate reduction for authorizing our loan servicer to automatically deduct your payments each month from your bank account (Autopay). APR ranges may include interest rate incentives only available to applicants with a creditworthy cosigner.</p>
          <p><sup>2</sup> Autopay Benefit: During Periods when payments are due, borrowers are eligible to receive a 0.50 percentage point interest rate reduction on their loan by authorizing our loan servicer to automatically deduct payments each month from the borrower’s bank account. The interest rate reduction for authorizing our servicer to automatically deduct monthly payments from a savings or checking account will not reduce the monthly payment, but will reduce the monthly finance charge, resulting in a lower total cost of loan.</p>
